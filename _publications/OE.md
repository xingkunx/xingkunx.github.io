* The ocean states within typhoon systems and the variations in offshore wind & wave energy during typhoons passing over the northern SCS are analyzed.
* A survey of offshore wind and wave energy exploitation safety during typhoon Hato (2017) is performed.
* This study identifies survival OWTs and WECs during typhonn Hato.
