Education
======
* Ph.D. in Ocean Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia, 2022.
* Ph.D. candidate in Physical Oceanography, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China, 2017.
* B.S. in Marine Sciences, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China, 2015.

Work experience
======
Scientist at Technology Centre for Offshore and Marine, Singapore (Sep 2024 - Present)
 * Spearhead the development of the regional ocean model configuration for the Maritime Continent (MC) domain, incorporating river runoff inputs into the NEMO framework.
 * Execute comprehensive hindcast experiments utilizing the NEMO model, with and without river runoff integration, followed by rigorous validation and comparison against satellite observations and in-situ measurements.
 * Engage in the advancement of the atmosphere-ocean-wave coupled modeling system.
    
Research Fellow at National University of Singapore, Singapore (Nov 2023 - Present)
  * Investigation into the effects of climate change on coastal dynamics, with a focus on downscaling methodologies and projections for oceanic and wave climatology through using WW3.
  * Advancement of probability distribution frameworks and extreme value theory for the analysis of storm surges, ocean currents, wave patterns, and tidal phenomena.
  * Development of advanced modeling techniques to simulate extreme local wind wave and storm surge scenarios, aimed at enhancing the understanding of compounded regional weather risks in Southeast Asia.
    
Project Researcher at University of Tokyo, Japan (May 2022 - Nov 2023)
  * Spearhead the development and operational implementation of wave-ice coupled numerical models based on ROMS, while conducting research to elucidate the processes and current state of environmental changes in the Arctic.
  * Conduct in-depth investigations into the impact of non-breaking wave-induced turbulence on upper ocean dynamics in polar regions, and examine the influence of ocean waves on sea ice disintegration within Arctic cyclone systems.
  * Contribute to the establishment of a remotely accessible platform designed to facilitate Arctic and Antarctic research cruises, thereby enhancing the operational capabilities for polar scientific exploration.
