I am a physical oceanographer and ocean engineer at the Tropical Marine Science Institute, National University of Singapore (NUS).

My expertise spans various areas, including atmosphere, ocean and wave dynamics and numerical modeling, and field, satellite, and reanalysis data processing. Specifically, I focus on:

* The influence of ocean waves on air-sea boundary layers and wave-ice interaction under extreme weather conditions.
* Downscaling and projecting ocean and wave climatology.
* Wind and wave energy assessments through the use of regional high-resolution numerical models
