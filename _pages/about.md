I am a physical oceanographer and ocean engineer at the Tropical Marine Science Institute, National University of Singapore (NUS).

My expertise spans various areas, including atmosphere, ocean and wave dynamics and numerical modeling, and field, satellite, and reanalysis data processing. Specifically, I focus on:

* Impact of ocean waves on the air-sea boundary layers.
* Wave-ice interaction within the Arctic Cyclones system.
* Wave climatology downscaling and projection.
* Wave energy assessments through the use of high-resolution spectral wave models.
