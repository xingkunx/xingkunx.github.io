I am currently serving as a Research Fellow at the Tropical Marine Science Institute, National University of Singapore (NUS).

My expertise spans various areas, including wave dynamics, atmospheric and oceanic modeling, and in-situ data processing. I specialize in studies concerning the impact of ocean waves on the air-sea boundary layers; the wave-ice interaction within the Arctic Cyclones system; the wave climatology downscaling and projection; the wave energy assessments through using high-resolution spectral wave models.
