I am a physical oceanographer and ocean engineer at the Tropical Marine Science Institute, National University of Singapore (NUS).

My expertise spans various areas, including wave dynamics, atmospheric and oceanic modeling, and in-situ data processing. Specifically, I focus on:

* Impact of ocean waves on the air-sea boundary layers.
* Wave-ice interaction within the Arctic Cyclones system.
* Wave climatology downscaling and projection.
* Wave energy assessments through the use of high-resolution spectral wave models.
