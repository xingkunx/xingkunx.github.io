We illustrate that the impacts of sea spray-induced heat energy fluxes on the Tropical Cyclone modeling largely depend on current sea spray schemes. Thus, more reliable observations in the laboratory and field are needed for the validation of existing wave breaking (sea spray heat energy fluexes) microphysical schemes.
