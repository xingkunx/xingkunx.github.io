The wind can tear off droplets from the wave crests to produce sea spray. These airborne droplets can then modulate the energy of heat and momentum, leading to changes in Tropical Cyclone intensity. In this study, we use laser altimeter observations obtained at a fixed observational platform located on the north shelf of Western Australia to obtain rare estimates of the sea spray flux in the field.
